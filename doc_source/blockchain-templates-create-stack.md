# Create the Ethereum Network<a name="blockchain-templates-create-stack"></a>

The Ethereum network you specify using the AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum in this topic launches an AWS CloudFormation stack that creates an Amazon ECS cluster of EC2 instances for the Ethereum network\. The AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum relies on the resources you created earlier in [Set Up Prerequisites](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md)\.

When you launch the AWS CloudFormation stack using the template, it creates nested stacks for some tasks\. After they are complete, you can connect to resources served through the network's Application Load Balancer to verify that your Ethereum network is running and accessible\. 

**To create the Ethereum network using AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum**

1. Open the latest AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum in the AWS CloudFormation console using the following quick\-links for the AWS Region in which you are working:
   + [Launch in US East \(N\. Virginia\) region \(us\-east\-1\)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://aws-blockchain-templates-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ethereum/templates/latest/ethereum-network.template.yaml)
   + [Launch in US East \(Ohio\) region \(us\-east\-2\)](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://aws-blockchain-templates-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ethereum/templates/latest/ethereum-network.template.yaml)
   + [Launch in US West \(Oregon\) region \(us\-west\-2\)](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://aws-blockchain-templates-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ethereum/templates/latest/ethereum-network.template.yaml)

1. Enter values according to the following guidelines:
   + For **Stack name**, enter a name that is easy for you to identify\. This name is used within the names of resources that the stack creates\.
   + Under **Ethereum Network Parameters** and **Private Ethereum Network Parameters**, leave the default settings\.
   + Under **Platform configuration**, leave the default settings, which creates an Amazon ECS cluster of EC2 instances\. The alternative, **docker\-local** creates an Ethereum network using a single EC2 instance\.
   + For **VPC ID**, select the VPC that you created earlier in [Create a VPC and Subnets](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#blockchain-templates-create-a-vpc)\.
   + For **List of VPC Subnets to use**, select the single private subnet that you created earlier in the procedure [To create the VPC](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#create-vpc-procedure)\.
   + For **Application Load Balancer Subnet IDs**, select two public subnets from the [list of subnets](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#list-of-subnets) that you noted earlier, after you created the VPC and the additional public subnet\.
   + For **EC2 Key Pair**, select a key pair\. For information about creating a key pair, see [Create a Key Pair](blockchain-templates-setting-up.md#blockchain-templates-create-a-key-pair)\.
   + For **EC2 Security Group**, select the security group you created earlier in [Create Security Groups](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#blockchain-templates-create-security-group)\.
   + For **IAM Role for ECS**, enter the ARN of the ECS role that you created earlier in [Create an IAM Role for Amazon ECS and an EC2 Instance Profile](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#blockchain-templates-iam-roles)\.
   + For **EC2 Instance Profile ARN**, enter the ARN of the instance profile that you created earlier in [Create an IAM Role for Amazon ECS and an EC2 Instance Profile](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#blockchain-templates-iam-roles)\.
   + For **Application Load Balancer Security Group**, select the security group for the Application Load Balancer that you created earlier in [Create Security Groups](blockchain-template-getting-started-prerequisites.md#blockchain-templates-create-security-group)\.
   + Under **ECS cluster configuration**, leave the defaults, which creates an ECS cluster of three EC2 instances\.\.
   + For **EthStats**, leave the default setting, which is *true*\.
   + For **EthStats Connection Secret**, type an arbitrary value that is at least six characters\.
   + For **EthExplorer**, leave the default setting, which is *true*\.

1. Leave all other settings to their defaults, select the acknowledgement check box, and choose **Create**\.

   The **Stack Detail** page for the root stack that AWS CloudFormation launches appears\.

1. To monitor the progress of the root stack and nested stacks, choose **Stacks**\.

1. When all stacks show **CREATE\_COMPLETE** for **Status**, you can connect to Ethereum user interfaces to verify that the network is running and accessible\. When you use the ECS container platform, URLs for connecting to EthStats, EthExplorer, and EthJsonRPC through the Application Load Balancer are available on the **Outputs** tab\. The Application Load Balancer is secure, so it requires that you connect to it through a *bastion host*, which proxies connections to help provide secure access to the Application Load Balancer\. For more information, see [ Connecting to Ethereum Resources  After the root stack that you create with the AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum shows **CREATE\_COMPLETE**, you can connect to Ethereum resources using the AWS CloudFormation console\. How you connect depends on the container platform that you choose, ECS or docker\-local:  **ECS**—The **Output** tab of the root stack provides links to services running on the Application Load Balancer\. These URLs are not directly accessible for security reasons\. To connect, you can set up and use a *bastion host* to proxy connections to them\. For more information, see [Proxy Connections Using a Bastion Host](#ethereum-create-bastion-host) below\. **docker\-local**—You connect using the IP address of the EC2 instance hosting Ethereum services as listed below\. Use the EC2 console to find the *ec2\-IP\-address* of the instance that the AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum created\.  **EthStats**—Use http://*ec2\-IP\-address* **EthExplorer**—Use http://*ec2\-IP\-address*:8080 **EthJsonRpc**—Use http://*ec2\-IP\-address*:8545  If you specified a public subnet for **Ethereum Network Subnet ID** \(**List of VPC Subnets to use** within the AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum\), you can connect directly\. Your client must be a trusted source of inbound traffic for SSH \(port 22\), as well as the ports listed\. This is determined by the **EC2 Security Group** that you specified using the AWS Blockchain Template for Ethereum\. If you specified a private subnet, you can set up and use a *bastion host* to proxy connections to these addresses\. For more information, see [Proxy Connections Using a Bastion Host](#ethereum-create-bastion-host) below\.    Proxy Connections Using a Bastion Host With some configurations, Ethereum services may not be publicly available\. In those cases, you can connect to Ethereum resources through a *bastion host*\. For more information about bastion hosts, see [Linux Bastion Host Architecture](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/architecture.html) in the *Linux Bastion Host Quick Start Guide*\. The bastion host is an EC2 instance\. Make sure that the following requirements are met:  The EC2 instance for the bastion host is within a public subnet with Auto\-assign Public IP enabled and that has an internet gateway\.  The bastion host has the key pair that allows ssh connections\. The bastion host is associated with a security group that allows inbound SSH traffic from the clients that connect\. The security group assigned to the Ethereum hosts \(for example, the Application Load Balancer if ECS is the container platform, or the host EC2 instance if docker\-local is the container platform\) allows inbound traffic on all ports from sources within the VPC\.  With a bastion host set up, ensure that the clients that connect use the bastion host as a proxy\. The following example demonstrates setting up a proxy connection using Mac OS\. Replace *BastionIP* with the IP address of the bastion host EC2 instance and *MySshKey\.pem* with the key pair file that you copied to the bastion host\. On the command line, type the following: 

```
ssh -i mySshKey.pem  ec2-user@BastionIP -D 9001
``` This sets up port forwarding for port 9001 on the local machine to the bastion host\. Next, configure your browser or system to use SOCKS proxy for `localhost:9001`\. For example, using Mac OS, select **System Preferences**, **Network**, **Advanced**, select **SOCKS proxy**, and type **localhost:9001**\. Using FoxyProxy Standard with Chrome, select **More Tools**, **Extensions**\. Under **FoxyProxy Standard**, select **Details**, **Extension options**, **Add New Proxy**\. Select **Manual Proxy Configuration**\. For **Host or IP Address** type **localhost** and for **Port** type **9001**\. Select **SOCKS proxy?**, **Save**\. You should now be able to connect to the Ethereum host addresses listed earlier int his topic\.  ](blockchain-templates-ethereum.md#blockchain-ethereum-connecting)\.
